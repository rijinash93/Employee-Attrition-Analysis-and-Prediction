Problem Statement:
Employee turnover poses a significant challenge for organizations, resulting in increased costs, reduced productivity, and team disruptions. Understanding the factors driving attrition and predicting at-risk employees is critical for effective retention strategies. This project aims to analyze employee data, identify key drivers of attrition, and build predictive models to support proactive decision-making in workforce management.
Business Use Cases:
Employee Retention: Identify at-risk employees and implement targeted strategies to reduce turnover.
Cost Optimization: Minimize recruitment, onboarding, and training costs associated with high attrition rates.
Workforce Planning: Use predictive insights to align retention strategies with organizational goals and improve employee satisfaction.


Approach:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather relevant employee data, including demographics, job roles, performance, tenure, and exit interviews. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct in-depth analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and key factors influencing attrition, such as salary, job satisfaction, and department.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like tenure categories, performance metrics, and engagement scores to enhance model accuracy.
Model Building: Implement predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to predict employee attrition. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Actionable Insights & Visualization: Create STREAMLIT dashboards and reports that provide HR teams with insights on attrition trends and at-risk employees, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

Results: 
Predictive Model Accuracy:
A highly accurate predictive model identifying employees at risk of attrition, with an optimal performance metric (e.g., accuracy, AUC-ROC) above a certain threshold (e.g., 85%).
Key Drivers of Attrition:
Identified significant factors influencing employee turnover, such as low job satisfaction, inadequate compensation, lack of career growth, or poor work-life balance.
At-Risk Employees:
A ranked list of employees with a high probability of leaving, enabling HR teams to take proactive measures such as offering retention bonuses, career development opportunities, or addressing specific concerns.
Impact of Retention Strategies:
Insights from the model suggesting potential retention strategies, leading to a reduction in the overall attrition rate, improved employee engagement, and reduced hiring and training costs.
Visual Dashboards & Reports:
Interactive dashboards visualizing attrition trends, key factors, and predictive insights, helping HR departments make informed decisions.

Project Evaluation metrics:
Accuracy:
Measures the overall performance of the predictive model, indicating how often the model correctly predicts whether an employee will leave or stay.
Precision and Recall:
Precision: The percentage of correctly predicted "attrition" cases out of all predicted "attrition" cases.
Recall: The percentage of correctly predicted "attrition" cases out of all actual "attrition" cases.
These metrics help assess the balance between false positives and false negatives in predicting attrition.
F1-Score:
The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate the model’s ability to correctly identify at-risk employees.
AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic):
A metric to assess the model's ability to discriminate between employees who will leave and those who will stay. A higher AUC indicates better model performance.
Confusion Matrix:
A matrix showing the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping visualize how well the model is performing across different categories.
Model Training Time and Computational Efficiency:
Evaluating how long the model takes to train and its computational efficiency, ensuring that it can scale effectively for large datasets.
Business Impact Metrics:
Attrition Rate Reduction: Improvement in retention rates following the implementation of the model’s recommendations.
Cost Savings: Reduction in recruitment, onboarding, and training costs due to better retention strategies informed by the model.
